🛠 Installation & Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/readify.git
cd readify

2. Install Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

3. Run on Android Studio / Emulator
flutter run

4. Required Dependencies (Already in pubspec.yaml)

Your project should include:

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  provider: ^6.0.5
  sqflite: ^2.0.0+4

5. iOS devices: Enable network images

Add this to ios/Runner/Info.plist:

This enables loading images through Image.network().

CREATE TABLE books (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title TEXT,
  author TEXT,
  coverUrl TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  totalPages INTEGER,
  currentPage INTEGER,
  category TEXT,
  rating REAL,
  notes TEXT
